GPT-2(TEXT AND CODE GENERATION)
</p>
<div class="class1">
<a name="intro" style="color:black;font-size:35px;"> <b>
Introduction: </b></a>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in open-ended language generation thanks to the rise of large transformer-based language models trained on millions of webpages, such as OpenAI's famous GPT2 model. 
The results on conditioned open-ended language generation are impressive, e.g. GPT2 on unicorns, XLNet, Controlled language with CTRL. Besides the improved transformer architecture and massive unsupervised training data, better decoding methods have also played an important role.

This blog post gives a brief overview of different decoding strategies and more importantly shows how you can implement them with very little effort using the popular transformers library!

All of the following functionalities can be used for auto-regressive language generation (here a refresher). In short, auto-regressive language generation is based on the assumption that the probability distribution of a word sequence can be decomposed into the product of conditional next word distributions:
<br><p style="text-align:center;">P(w<sub>1:T</sub>|W<sub>0</sub>) &nbsp;= &nbsp;&#x213F;(w<sub>t</sub>|w<sub>1:t-1</sub>,W<sub>0</sub>),with w<sub>1:0</sub>&nbsp= &nbsp;&#xd8;,</p><br>
and  W<sub>0</sub>  being the initial context word sequence. The length  T  of the word sequence is usually determined on-the-fly and corresponds to the timestep  t=T  the EOS token is generated from  P(w<sub>t</sub>|w<sub>1:tâˆ’1</sub>,W<sub>0</sub>) .

<br><br>Auto-regressive language generation is now available for GPT2, XLNet, OpenAi-GPT, CTRL, TransfoXL, XLM, Bart, T5 in both PyTorch and Tensorflow >= 2.0!

<br><br>We will give a tour of the currently most prominent decoding methods, mainly Greedy search, Beam search, Top-K sampling and Top-p sampling.
<br><br><br><a name="greedy" style="color:black;font-size:35px;"> <b>Greedy Search:</b></a>
<br><br>Greedy search simply selects the word with the highest probability as its next word:  wt=argmax<sub>w</sub>P(w|w<sub>1:tâˆ’1</sub>)  at each timestep  t . The following sketch shows greedy search.
<br><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/greedy_search.png" style="margin-left:350px; margin-right:350px">
<br>
<br>
Starting from the word  "The" , the algorithm greedily chooses the next word of highest probability  "nice"  and so on, so that the final generated word sequence is  "The", "nice", "woman"  having an overall probability of  0.5  &#xd7; 0.4 = 0.2 .

In the following we will generate word sequences using GPT2 on the context  ("I", "enjoy", "walking", "with", "my", "cute", "dog") . Let's see how greedy search can be used in transformers as follows:
<div style="border-style:groove; margin:20px;padding:15px;padding-top:0;">
<p style="background:#d4d7d2">
# encode context the generation is conditioned on<br>
input_ids = tokenizer.encode('I enjoy walking with my cute dog', return_tensors='tf')
<br>
<br>
# generate text until the output length (which includes the context length) reaches 50
<br>greedy_output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50)<br><br>

print("Output:\n" + 125 * '-')<br>
print(tokenizer.decode(greedy_output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))<br>
</p>
<br>
Output:<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>I enjoy walking with my cute dog, but I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to walk with my dog. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to walk with my dog.

<br>I'm not sure if I'll
</div>
Alright! We have generated our first short text with GPT2 ðŸ˜Š. The generated words following the context are reasonable, but the model quickly starts repeating itself! This is a very common problem in language generation in general and seems to be even more so in greedy and beam search.

<br><br>The major drawback of greedy search though is that it misses high probability words hidden behind a low probability word as can be seen in our sketch above:

<br><br>The word  "has"  with its high conditional probability of  0.9  is hidden behind the word  "dog" , which has only the second-highest conditional probability, so that greedy search misses the word sequence  "The","dog","has".

<br><br>Thankfully, we have beam search to alleviate this problem!
<br><br><a name="beam" style="color:black;font-size:35px;"> <b>Beam Search:</b></a>
<br><br>Beam search reduces the risk of missing hidden high probability word sequences by keeping the most likely num_beams of hypotheses at each time step and eventually choosing the hypothesis that has the overall highest probability. Let's illustrate with num_beams=2:
<br><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/beam_search.png" style="margin-left:350px; margin-right:350px">
<br>
<br>
At time step  1 , besides the most likely hypothesis  "The", "nice" , beam search also keeps track of the second most likely one  "The", "dog" . At time step  2 , beam search finds that the word sequence  "The", "dog", "has"  has with  0.36  a higher probability than  "The", "nice", "woman" , which has  0.2 . Great, it has found the most likely word sequence in our toy example!

<br><br>Beam search will always find an output sequence with higher probability than greedy search, but is not guaranteed to find the most likely output.

<br><br>Let's see how beam search can be used in transformers. We set num_beams > 1 and early_stopping=True so that generation is finished when all beam hypotheses reached the EOS token.
<div style="border-style:groove; margin:20px;padding:15px;padding-top:0;">
<p style="background:#d4d7d2">
# encode context the generation is conditioned on<br>
input_ids = tokenizer.encode('I enjoy walking with my cute dog', return_tensors='tf')
<br>
<br>
# activate beam search and early_stopping
<br>beam_output = model.generate(
    input_ids,  
    max_length=50, 
    num_beams=5, 
    early_stopping=True
)
<br><br>

print("Output:\n" + 100 * '-')<br>
print(tokenizer.decode(beam_output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))<br>
</p>
<br>
Output:<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>I enjoy walking with my cute dog, but I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to walk with him again.

<br>I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to walk with him again. I'm not sure if I'll
</div>
While the result is arguably more fluent, the output still includes repetitions of the same word sequences.
<br>A simple remedy is to introduce n-grams (a.k.a word sequences of  n  words) penalties as introduced by Paulus et al. (2017) and Klein et al. (2017). The most common n-grams penalty makes sure that no n-gram appears twice by manually setting the probability of next words that could create an already seen n-gram to  0 .

<br><br>Let's try it out by setting no_repeat_ngram_size=2 so that no 2-gram appears twice:
<div style="border-style:groove; margin:20px;padding:15px;padding-top:0;">
<p style="background:#d4d7d2">
# encode context the generation is conditioned on<br>
input_ids = tokenizer.encode('I enjoy walking with my cute dog', return_tensors='tf')
<br>
<br>
# set no_repeat_ngram_size to 2
<br>beam_output = model.generate(
    input_ids, 
    max_length=50, 
    num_beams=5, 
    no_repeat_ngram_size=2, 
    early_stopping=True
)
<br><br>

print("Output:\n" + 100 * '-')<br>
print(tokenizer.decode(beam_output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))<br>
</p>
<br>
Output:<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>I enjoy walking with my cute dog, but I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to walk with him again.

<br>I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I think it's time for me to take a break
</div>

Nice, that looks much better! We can see that the repetition does not appear anymore. Nevertheless, n-gram penalties have to be used with care. An article generated about the city New York should not use a 2-gram penalty or otherwise, the name of the city would only appear once in the whole text!

<br><br>Another important feature about beam search is that we can compare the top beams after generation and choose the generated beam that fits our purpose best.

<br><br>In transformers, we simply set the parameter num_return_sequences to the number of highest scoring beams that should be returned.<br> Make sure though that num_return_sequences <= num_beams !
<div style="border-style:groove; margin:20px;padding:15px;padding-top:0;">

# encode context the generation is conditioned on<br>
input_ids = tokenizer.encode('I enjoy walking with my cute dog', return_tensors='tf')

# set return_num_sequences > 1
<br>beam_outputs = model.generate(
    input_ids, 
    max_length=50, 
    num_beams=5, 
    no_repeat_ngram_size=2, 
    num_return_sequences=5, 
    early_stopping=True
)
<br><br>

# now we have 3 output sequences<br>
print("Output:\n" + 100 * '-')<br>
for i, beam_output in enumerate(beam_outputs):<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  print("{}: {}".format(i, tokenizer.decode(beam_output, skip_special_tokens=True)))
</p>
<br>

As can be seen, the five beam hypotheses are only marginally different to each other - which should not be too surprising when using only 5 beams.

<br><br>In open-ended generation, a couple of reasons have recently been brought forward why beam search might not be the best possible option:
<ul>
<li>Beam search can work very well in tasks where the length of the desired generation is more or less predictable as in machine translation or summarization - see Murray et al. (2018) and Yang et al. (2018). But this is not the case for open-ended generation where the desired output length can vary greatly, e.g. dialog and story generation.</li>

<br><li>We have seen that beam search heavily suffers from repetitive generation. This is especially hard to control with n-gram- or other penalties in story generation since finding a good trade-off between forced "no-repetition" and repeating cycles of identical n-grams requires a lot of finetuning.</li>

<br><li>As argued in Ari Holtzman et al. (2019), high quality human language does not follow a distribution of high probability next words. In other words, as humans, we want generated text to surprise us and not to be boring/predictable. The authors show this nicely by plotting the probability, a model would give to human text vs. what beam search does.</li>
</ul>

<img src="https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/images/2019/05/Screen_Shot_2019_05_08_at_3_06_36_PM-1557342561886.png" style="margin-left:400px; margin-right:400px">
<br>
So let's stop being boring and introduce some randomness ðŸ¤ª.
<br><br><a name="sample" style="color:black;font-size:35px;"> <b>Sampling: </b></a>
<br><br>
In its most basic form, sampling means randomly picking the next word  wt  according to its conditional probability distribution:

<br><br><p style="text-align:center;font-size:22px;">w<sub>t</sub>âˆ¼P(w|w<sub>1:tâˆ’1</sub>)</p>
<br>
Taking the example from above, the following graphic visualizes language generation when sampling.<br>
<br>
<br><img style="margin-left:250px; " src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/sampling_search.png"/>
<br><br>It becomes obvious that language generation using sampling is not deterministic anymore. The word  "car"  is sampled from the conditioned probability distribution  P(w|"The") , followed by sampling  "drives"  from  P(w|"The","car") .
<br><br>
In transformers, we set do_sample=True and deactivate Top-K sampling (more on this later) via top_k=0. In the following, we will fix random_seed=0 for illustration purposes. Feel free to change the random_seed to play around with the model.
<div style="border-style:groove; margin:20px;padding:15px;padding-top:0;">
<p style="background:#d4d7d2">
# set seed to reproduce results. Feel free to change the seed though to get different results
<br>tf.random.set_seed(0)

<br><br># activate sampling and deactivate top_k by setting top_k sampling to 0
<br>sample_output = model.generate(
    input_ids, 
    do_sample=True, 
    max_length=50, 
    top_k=0
)
<br><br>
print("Output:\n" + 100 * '-')
<br>print(tokenizer.decode(sample_output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
<br><br>
</p>

Output:<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>I enjoy walking with my cute dog. He just gave me a whole new hand sense."

<br>But it seems that the dogs have learned a lot from teasing at the local batte harness once they take on the outside.

</div>
Interesting! The text seems alright - but when taking a closer look, it is not very coherent. the 3-grams new hand sense and local batte harness are very weird and don't sound like they were written by a human. That is the big problem when sampling word sequences: The models often generate incoherent gibberish, cf. Ari Holtzman et al. (2019).
<Br><br>
A trick is to make the distribution  P(w|w<sub>1:tâˆ’1</sub>)  sharper (increasing the likelihood of high probability words and decreasing the likelihood of low probability words) by lowering the so-called temperature of the softmax.
<br><br>
An illustration of applying temperature to our example from above could look as follows.
<br>
<br><img style="margin-left:350px;" src="C:\Users\ragav\Downloads\sampling_search_with_temp.png" height="300" width="700"/>
<br><br>The conditional next word distribution of step  t=1  becomes much sharper leaving almost no chance for word  "car"  to be selected.

<br><br>Let's see how we can cool down the distribution in the library by setting temperature=0.7:
<div style="border-style:groove; margin:20px;padding:15px;padding-top:0;">
<p style="background:#d4d7d2">
# set seed to reproduce results. Feel free to change the seed though to get different results
<br>tf.random.set_seed(0)
<br>
<br>
# use temperature to decrease the sensitivity to low probability candidates
<br>sample_output = model.generate(
    input_ids, 
    do_sample=True, 
    max_length=50, 
    top_k=0, 
    temperature=0.7
)
<br>
<br>
print("Output:\n" + 100 * '-')<br>
print(tokenizer.decode(sample_output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
</p>
Output:<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>I enjoy walking with my cute dog, but I don't like to be at home too much. I also find it a bit weird when I'm out shopping. I am always away from my house a lot, but I do have a few friends
</div>
OK. There are less weird n-grams and the output is a bit more coherent now! While applying temperature can make a distribution less random, in its limit, when setting temperature  â†’0 , temperature scaled sampling becomes equal to greedy decoding and will suffer from the same problems as before.
<br><br><a name="topksample" style="color:black;font-size:35px;"> <b>Top-K Sampling:</b></a>
<br><br>Fan et. al (2018) introduced a simple, but very powerful sampling scheme, called Top-K sampling. In Top-K sampling, the K most likely next words are filtered and the probability mass is redistributed among only those K next words. GPT2 adopted this sampling scheme, which was one of the reasons for its success in story generation.
<br><br>
We extend the range of words used for both sampling steps in the example above from 3 words to 10 words to better illustrate Top-K sampling.
<br>
<br><img style="margin-left:350px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/top_k_sampling.png" height="300" width="700" \>
<br>
<br>
Having set  K=6 , in both sampling steps we limit our sampling pool to 6 words. While the 6 most likely words, defined as  Vtop-K  encompass only ca. two-thirds of the whole probability mass in the first step, it includes almost all of the probability mass in the second step. Nevertheless, we see that it successfully eliminates the rather weird candidates  "not", "the", "small", "told"  in the second sampling step.
<br>
<br>
Let's see how Top-K can be used in the library by setting top_k=50:
<div style="border-style:groove; margin:20px;padding:15px;padding-top:0;">
<p style="background:#d4d7d2">
# set seed to reproduce results. Feel free to change the seed though to get different results
<br>tf.random.set_seed(0)

<br><br># set top_k to 50
<br>sample_output = model.generate(
    input_ids, 
    do_sample=True, 
    max_length=50, 
    top_k=50
)
<br><br>
print("Output:\n" + 100 * '-')<br>
print(tokenizer.decode(sample_output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
</p>
Output:<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>I enjoy walking with my cute dog. It's so good to have an environment where your dog is available to share with you and we'll be taking care of you.

<br>We hope you'll find this story interesting!

<br>I am from
</div>
Not bad at all! The text is arguably the most human-sounding text so far. One concern though with Top-K sampling is that it does not dynamically adapt the number of words that are filtered from the next word probability distribution  P(w|w1:tâˆ’1) . This can be problematic as some words might be sampled from a very sharp distribution (distribution on the right in the graph above), whereas others from a much more flat distribution (distribution on the left in the graph above).

<br><br>In step  t=1 , Top-K eliminates the possibility to sample  "people", "big", "house", "cat" , which seem like reasonable candidates. On the other hand, in step  t=2  the method includes the arguably ill-fitted words  "down", "a"  in the sample pool of words. Thus, limiting the sample pool to a fixed size K could endanger the model to produce gibberish for sharp distributions and limit the model's creativity for flat distribution. This intuition led Ari Holtzman et al. (2019) to create Top-p- or nucleus-sampling.

<br><br><a name="toppsample" style="color:black;font-size:35px;"> <b>Top-p (nucleus) sampling</b></a>
<br><br>Instead of sampling only from the most likely K words, in Top-p sampling chooses from the smallest possible set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds the probability p. The probability mass is then redistributed among this set of words. This way, the size of the set of words (a.k.a the number of words in the set) can dynamically increase and decrease according to the next word's probability distribution. Ok, that was very wordy, let's visualize
<br>
<br><img style="margin-left:350px;" src="https://github.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/blob/master/top_p_sampling.png?raw=true" height="300" width="700" />
<br>
<br>Having set  p=0.92 , Top-p sampling picks the minimum number of words to exceed together  p=92%  of the probability mass, defined as  V<sub>top-p</sub> . In the first example, this included the 9 most likely words, whereas it only has to pick the top 3 words in the second example to exceed 92%. Quite simple actually! It can be seen that it keeps a wide range of words where the next word is arguably less predictable, e.g.  P(w|"The") , and only a few words when the next word seems more predictable, e.g.  P(w|"The", "car") .

<br>
<br>Alright, time to check it out in transformers! We activate Top-p sampling by setting 0 < top_p < 1:
<div style="border-style:groove; margin:20px;padding:15px;padding-top:0;">
<p style="background:#d4d7d2">
# set seed to reproduce results. Feel free to change the seed though to get different results
<br>tf.random.set_seed(0)
<br>
<br>
# deactivate top_k sampling and sample only from 92% most likely words
<br>sample_output = model.generate(
    input_ids, 
    do_sample=True, 
    max_length=50, 
    top_p=0.92, 
    top_k=0
)
<br>
<br>
print("Output:\n" + 100 * '-')<br>
print(tokenizer.decode(sample_output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
</p>
Output:<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>I enjoy walking with my cute dog. He will never be the same. I watch him play.
<br>Guys, my dog needs a name. Especially if he is found with wings.

Great, that sounds like it could have been written by a human. Well, maybe not quite yet.

<br><br>While in theory, Top-p seems more elegant than Top-K, both methods work well in practice. Top-p can also be used in combination with Top-K, which can avoid very low ranked words while allowing for some dynamic selection.

<br>
<br>Finally, to get multiple independently sampled outputs, we can again set the parameter num_return_sequences > 1:
